# React + Vite

This website is a prototype showcasing how we can create a landing page based on the [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/GIrurcGtyHKB5hCkZB4cqM/Startupz---Landing-page?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=CTSPwV0iqn8GXRqm-0) design I received.
Additionally, for the contact form, we have also used a mail library that enables the actual sending of emails.

These constitute the procedural steps required to perform the cloning of the project and its initiation:
- Clone the project
- Execute ```npm i``` to install the packages
- Create a ```.env``` file based on ```.env.example``
- Execute ```npm run dev``` in the terminal to initiate the application.
- Open a web browser and enter ```http://localhost:5173/```.

## Most important libraries
- Vite
- Tailwindcss
- Axios
- Yup
- Formik

## ENV example
VITE_API_URL =

## Unfinished work
- Technical debt - The code requires restructuring. In essence, it is advisable to generate several smaller components and CSS classes that are essential across multiple pages.
